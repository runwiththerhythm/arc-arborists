## Lighthouse Audit

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports. Avoid testing the local version (Gitpod/VSCode/etc.), as this can have knock-on effects for performance. If you don't have "Lighthouse" in your Developer Tools, it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Unless your project is a single-page application (SPA), you should test Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages, for both *mobile* and *desktop*.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

## Defensive Programming

Areas of user input have been tested 


## Bugs

If/when you encounter bugs during the development stages of your project, you should document them here, ideally with a screenshot explaining what the issue was, and what you did to fix the bug.

Alternatively, an improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **[Issues](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues)** tracker on your GitHub repository. This can be found at the top of your repository, the tab called "Issues".

If using the Issues tracker for bug management, you can simplify the documentation process for testing. Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue page without having to first save the screenshot locally. You can add labels to your issues (e.g. `bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s). Once you've solved the issue/bug, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following examples below.

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3Arunwiththerhythm%2Farc-arborists%20label%3Abug&label=bugs)](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

![screenshot](documentation/testing/fixed-bugs.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention any unfixed bugs and why they are not fixed upon submission of your project. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. Where possible, you must fix all outstanding bugs, unless outside of your control.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here! It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue, they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists)](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues)

Any remaining open issues can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues).

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/gh-issues-open.png)

### Known Issues

Due to the colour variation in the footer image, I have used a drop show effect to outline some of the text to ensure it can be read easily across all devices. This has caused issue with some colour contrast checkers, however I have made changes to the shades of green used to ensure the best contrast between foreground and background colours across the site.

My initial commit messages did not start with a capital letter and were not always descriptive enough. After some helpful advice from my Code Institute mentor I have improved these since.

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have horizontal `overflow-x` scrolling. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/overflow.png) |
| When validating HTML with a semantic `<section>` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/section-header.png) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After having tested the site thoroughly, there are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, however there is always a small possibility something may have been missed or not initiated.
