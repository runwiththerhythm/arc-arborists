## Bugs

If/when you encounter bugs during the development stages of your project, you should document them here, ideally with a screenshot explaining what the issue was, and what you did to fix the bug.

Alternatively, an improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **[Issues](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues)** tracker on your GitHub repository. This can be found at the top of your repository, the tab called "Issues".

If using the Issues tracker for bug management, you can simplify the documentation process for testing. Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue page without having to first save the screenshot locally. You can add labels to your issues (e.g. `bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s). Once you've solved the issue/bug, you should then "Close" it.

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3Arunwiththerhythm%2Farc-arborists%20label%3Abug&label=bugs)](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

![screenshot](documentation/testing/fixed-bugs.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

- All bugs have been fixed and there are no remaining open bugs.
- One remaining issue is open for implementation of a blog which will be added in the future.

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists)](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues)

Any remaining open issues can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/arc-arborists/issues).


### Known Issues

Due to the colour variation in the footer image, I have used a drop show effect to outline some of the text to ensure it can be read easily across all devices. This has caused issue with some colour contrast checkers, however I have made changes to the shades of green used to ensure the best contrast between foreground and background colours across the site.

My initial commit messages did not start with a capital letter and were not always descriptive enough. After some helpful advice from my Code Institute mentor I have improved these since.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After having tested the site thoroughly, there are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, however there is always a small possibility something may have been missed or not initiated.
